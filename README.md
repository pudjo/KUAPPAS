SIKUATThis is an example of some of what I have created, namely the Winform application using Visual C#.
This application is a financial application used to manage local government finances. So sorry in Indonesian. At least know that I am able to work on applications with Visual C# Winform mode. This application is also the result of an upgrade that previously used VB6. The application consists of 2 projects. The first project is the financial project itself, while the second project is used to create a Sidebar from the application so that it looks professional. I took the application from GitHub https://github.com/kernelENREK/Z80_NavigationBar To run this application, the user pudjo and password Puyi54321 are used
